Checking the pages and business logic of the project in different ways

The main goal of testing is to make sure that the site meets the stated requirements of the client, and to identify errors that may adversely affect the operation of the resource.

Typically, the testing process goes hand in hand with development. QA-engineer is connected even at the moment of creating the technical task and draws up a test plan and test cases. As soon as the layout is ready, the specialist tests it. After the implementation of the project, the QA engineer tests the functionality, business logic and checks the finished project for compliance with the terms of reference.

### Technical requirements:

Optimizing the site for all devices so that it looks and functions well
 Hosting a website on a secure server (SSL), make it available via the HTTPS protocol.



#### After the completion of the development under the main contract, when the project has already been delivered or even released, it is then possible to conclude a new technical support contract with a fixed cost per month
